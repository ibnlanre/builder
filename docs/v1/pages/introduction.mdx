# Welcome

The `@ibnlanre/builder` package is a tool designed to streamline the management of keys within a code base. It provides a consistent and reliable method for generating keys dynamically, making it easier to work with key-based data structures.

The primary goal of this package is to shift the focus from key creation to key usage, allowing developers to concentrate on building features. Lightweight and user-friendly, `@ibnlanre/builder` can be seamlessly incorporated into any [JavaScript][pluralsight] or [TypeScript][typescript] project.

It is really nice! It's <strong>lightweight</strong> and robust.<br />Builder is [0.4KB][bundlephobia] gzipped. That's very very light!<br /><small className="nx-not-italic nx-mt-3 nx-inline-block">— [Hemense Lan](https://linkedin.com/in/hemense-lan)</small></blockquote>

## Motivation

The package was motivated by the need for an efficient, type-safe solution for constructing keys. It encapsulates keys and values in a structured manner, promoting code organization, reusability, and maintainability. Furthermore, it simplifies the process of defining and accessing values, reducing the cognitive load associated with key management and enhancing code readability.

Honestly can't have it any other way.<br /><small className="nx-not-italic nx-mt-3 nx-inline-block">— [Prosper Jaja](https://linkedin.com/in/prosper-jaja-3076aa264)</small></blockquote>
