# Builder

The `builder` object is a tree-like graph that provides mechanisms for crafting complex key structures and accessing associated values within a given [register][4]. It is created from a [register][4] object using the [createBuilder][2] function, and serves as the main interface for querying the [register][4].

The `builder` object is an enhanced version of the [register][4] object, augmented with the `$use` and `$get` property. These properties exist on every level of the `builder` object, facilitating the creation of dynamic keys at the point of access. To avoid conflicts with other keys within your register, the `$use` and `$get` methods are prefixed with a `$` sign.

The following code snippet defines a typical [register][4] object:

```typescript copy
const register = {
  location: (id: number) => `/location/${id}`,
  address: {
    country: 'Nigeria',
  },
};

const builder = createBuilder(register);
```

The following code snippet illustrates the similarities between a [register][4] and its `builder`. Note that the `$use` property is a function on every level except the root level, while the `$get` method is a function on every level:

```typescript copy
{
  $use: register,
  $get: () => [],
  location: {
    $use: (id: number) => ['location', id],
    $get: () => ['location'],
  },
  address: {
    $use: () => ['address'],
    $get: () => ['address'],
    country: {
      $use: () => ['address', 'country'],
      $get: () => ['address', 'country'],
    },
  },
};
```
