# Registers

A `register` is a plain object that contains the keys and values that you want to access. The `register` can contain nested objects, functions, or values. To effectively use the [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package, a register is passed as an argument to the [createBuilder][2] function, which returns a [builder][3] object. 

The [builder][3] object adds additional functionalities to the `register` that facilitates the dynamic generation of keys. The `register` is the **soul** of the [builder][3] object, as it is the source from which it derives its keys and values. This guide explains how to define a `register` and how to structure it effectively.

The following code snippet displays a sample `register` object:

```typescript copy
const register = {
  user: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john.doe@jmail.com'
  },
};
```

## Nested registers

Registers can be made to have complex structures by nesting objects within objects. This allows you to group related keys and values together. The recommended approach is to keep the `register` as flat as possible, to avoid unnecessary complexity. This can be achieved by creating multiple registers, each with a specific purpose, and nesting them within the main `register`.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a `register` with nested objects:

```typescript copy
const create = (data: { email: string; password: string }) => {
  return fetch("/account/create", {
    headers: {
      Accept: "application/json",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
    method: "POST",
  });
};

const delete_by_id = (id: number) => {
  return fetch(`/account/${id}/delete`, {
    method: "DELETE",
  });
};

const register = {
  account: {
    delete_by_id,
    create,
  },
};
```
