# @ibnlanre/builder

The `@ibnlanre/builder` package was designed to simplify the management of keys within a code base. By offering a consistent and reliable method for generating keys dynamically, it enhances the ease of working with key-based data structures. Its primary goal is to shift the focus from key deliberation to key usage, enabling developers to concentrate on building features. The `@ibnlanre/builder` package is lightweight and easy to use. It's user-friendly and versatile, and can be incorporated into any [JavaScript][pluralsight] or [TypeScript][typescript] project.

It is really nice! It's <strong>lightweight</strong> and robust.<br />Builder is 11k gzipped. That's very very light!<br /><small className="nx-not-italic nx-mt-3 nx-inline-block">— [Hemense Lan](https://linkedin.com/in/hemense-lan)</small></blockquote>

The motivation behind the `@ibnlanre/builder` package is to provide an efficient, and type-safe solution for constructing keys. By encapsulating keys and values in a structured manner, it promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability. It also simplifies the process of defining values and accessing them, reducing the cognitive load associated with key management, and improving code readability.

Honestly can't have it any other way.<br /><small className="nx-not-italic nx-mt-3 nx-inline-block">— [Prosper Jaja](https://linkedin.com/in/prosper-jaja-3076aa264)</small></blockquote>

It is suitable for **large teams** working on complex projects, as it ensures consistent key generation and easy access to values. It automatically synchronizes changes to keys and values, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies. Additionally, it encourages collocating related keys and values, making it easier to organize and maintain the code base. By enabling the encapsulation of common functionality into accessible values, it promotes code reuse and improves overall code quality. 

It is also suitable for **small teams** and **individual developers** working on smaller projects, seeking a type-safe and efficient way to work with keys. It is an invaluable tool for developers who want to focus on building features rather than managing keys, in an organized fashion.
