Honestly can't have it any other way.<br /><small className="nx-not-italic nx-mt-3 nx-inline-block">— [Prosper Jaja](https://linkedin.com/in/prosper-jaja-3076aa264)</small></blockquote>

The `@ibnlanre/builder` library is a package designed to streamline dynamic key generation, thus addressing the complex issue of cache key management and invalidation. By chaining the nodes of a [register][4] into an array of keys, it eliminates the need for manual construction of keys. This is achieved through a [builder][3] object, created using the [createBuilder][2] function. This object contains methods for retrieving the key and its value, making it easier to work with the stored data.

It is really nice! It's <strong>lightweight</strong> and robust.<br />Builder is 11k gzipped. That's very very light!<br /><small className="nx-not-italic nx-mt-3 nx-inline-block">— [Hemense Lan](https://linkedin.com/in/hemense-lan)</small></blockquote>

The `@ibnlanre/builder` package is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, and can be integrated with minimal effort. It's user-friendly and versatile, and can be incorporated into any [JavaScript][pluralsight] or [TypeScript][typescript] project. The principle behind the package is the generation of keys dynamically, which implies that keys can be used in a variety of scenarios, depending on the requirements of the project.
