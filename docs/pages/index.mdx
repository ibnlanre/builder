The `@ibnlanre/builder` library is a package designed to streamline dynamic key generation, thus addressing the complex issue of cache key management and invalidation. By chaining the nodes of a register into an array of keys, it eliminates the need for manual construction of keys. This is achieved through a `builder` object, created using the `createBuilder` function. This object contains methods for retrieving the value of a key, making it easier to locate and reuse keys.

It is really nice! It's <strong>lightweight</strong> and robust.<br />Builder is 11k gzipped. That's very very light!<br /><small>— [Hemense Lan](https://linkedin.com/in/hemense-lan)</small></blockquote>

The `@ibnlanre/builder` package is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, and can be integrated with minimal effort. It's user-friendly and versatile, and can be incorporated into any JavaScript or TypeScript project. The principle behind the package is the generation of keys dynamically, which implies that keys can be used in a variety of scenarios, depending on the requirements of the project.

## Motivation

The `@ibnlanre/builder` package was created to address the issue of thinking about and managing keys in a data structure. It simplifies the process of key creation and management by providing a consistent and reliable way to generate keys dynamically. This makes it easier to work with key-based data structures, and shifts the focus from key deliberation to key usage.

It is suitable for **large teams** working on complex projects, as it ensures that keys are generated consistently and that values are easily accessible. It automatically synchronizes changes to keys and values, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies. It also encourages collocating related keys and values, making it easier to organize and maintain the codebase. By enabling the encapsulation of common functionality into accessible values, it promotes code reuse and improves overall code quality. 

It is also suitable for **small teams** and **individual developers** working on smaller projects, seeking a type-safe and efficient way to work with keys. It is an invaluable tool for developers who want to focus on building features rather than managing keys, in an organized fashion.
