# createBuilder

The `createBuilder` function is a factory function that facilitates the creation of a [builder][3] object. The `createBuilder` function is a named export from the [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package. This guide explains how to create a [builder][3] object using the `createBuilder` function.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to import the `createBuilder` function:

```typescript copy
import { createBuilder } from '@ibnlanre/builder';
```

## Creating a builder

The `createBuilder` function takes a [register][4] object and an optional array of prefixes as arguments. Invoking it, returns a [builder][3] object that can be used to access the keys and values in the [register][4] object. The [builder][3] object adds a layer of abstraction to the [register][4] object, allowing you to dynamically generate keys.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to invoke the `createBuilder` function:

```typescript copy
const noPrefixBuilder = createBuilder(register);
```

## Builder with prefixes

If the [builder][3] object is created with prefixes, the generated keys array would be prefixed with the prefixes, followed by the keys accessed in the [register][4]. The prefixes serve as an identifier for each [builder][3] object created. Although there is no limit to the number of prefixes that can be used, it is advised to use a maximum of three prefixes.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to call the `createBuilder` function with prefixes:

```typescript copy
const prefixedBuilder = createBuilder(register, { prefix: ["user", "record"] });
```
