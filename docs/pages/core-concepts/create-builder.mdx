# createBuilder

The `createBuilder` function is a factory function that accepts a [register][4] and an optional list of prefixes as arguments. `createBuilder` is exported as a named export from the [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package. This guide explains how to create a [builder][3] object using the `createBuilder` function.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to import the `createBuilder` function:

```typescript copy
import { createBuilder } from '@ibnlanre/builder';
```

## Creating a builder
To get started with the [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package, you need to create a [builder][3] object using the `createBuilder` function. The `createBuilder` function takes two arguments: the register object and an optional array of prefixes. The register object is a nested object that contains keys and values, while the prefixes array is used to generate keys for the register object.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a [builder][3] object using the `createBuilder` function:

```typescript copy
const noPrefixBuilder = createBuilder(register);
```

## Builder with prefixes

If the [builder][3] object is created with prefixes, the generated keys array would be prefixed with the prefixes, followed by the keys accessed in the [register][4]. The prefixes serve as an identifier for each [builder][3] object created. Although there is no limit to the number of prefixes that can be used, it is advised to use a maximum of three prefixes.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `createBuilder` function with prefixes:

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder(register, ["user", "record"]);
```
