# Builder

The `builder` object is a tree-like structure that provides mechanisms for accessing the keys and values of a [register][4]. It is created from a [register][4] using the [createBuilder][2] function, and should serve as the main interface for querying the [register][4]. Every level of the `builder` object has two methods: `use` and `get`. Both methods are used to access the keys and values of the [register][4].

The following code snippet defines a typical [register][4] object:

```typescript copy
const register = {
  location: (id: number) => `/location/${id}`,
  address: {
    country: 'Nigeria',
  },
};
```

The following code snippet shows the `builder` object of the above [register][4]:

```typescript copy
const builder = {
  use: () => register,
  get: () => [],
  location: {
    use: (id: number) => ['location', id],
    get: () => ['location'],
  },
  address: {
    use: () => ['address'],
    get: () => ['address'],
    country: {
      use: () => ['address', 'country'],
      get: () => ['address', 'country'],
    },
  },
};
```
