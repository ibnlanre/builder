//  The  useBuilderProvider  function is a custom hook that creates a  BuilderProvider  component and a  useBuilder  hook. The  BuilderProvider  component is a context provider that provides the  builders  prop to all its children. The  useBuilder  hook is used to access the  builders  prop in any child component.
//  The  useBuilderProvider  function takes two type parameters:  Register  and  Prefix . The  Register  type is a dictionary of registered components, while the  Prefix  type is an array of strings that represent the path to the registered component.
//  The  Builders  type is a record of builders, where the key is the name of the builder and the value is the builder function. The  BuilderProviderProps  type is a props object that takes the  builders  prop and children as its properties.
//  The  useBuilderProvider  function returns an object with two properties:  useBuilder  and  Provider . The  useBuilder  function is a custom hook that returns the builder function for a given name. The  Provider  property is a JSX element that wraps the children with the  BuilderContext.Provider  component.
//  Now that we have defined the  useBuilderProvider  function, we can use it to create a  BuilderProvider  component that provides the  builders  prop to all its children.
//  Step 3: Create a BuilderProvider Component
//  Next, we will create a  BuilderProvider  component that uses the  useBuilderProvider  function to provide the  builders  prop to all its children.


//  The  BuilderProvider  component is a context provider that provides the  builders  prop to all its children. It uses the  useBuilderProvider  function to create a  BuilderProvider  component and a  useBuilder  hook. The  useBuilder  hook is used to access the  builders  prop in any child component.

// import { createBuilder } from "../create-builder";

// const userBuilder = createBuilder({
//   user: {
//     name: "John Doe",
//     age: 30,
//   },
// });

// const { useBuilder, BuilderProvider } = createBuilderProvider({
//   userBuilder,
// });

// type builders = keyof typeof userBuilder;

// function Component() {
//   const { userBuilder } = useBuilder();
//   const user = userBuilder.use().user.age;
//   const key = userBuilder.user.age.use();
// }
