# Overview

At its core, `@ibnlanre/builder` is designed to be [framework-agnostic][agnostic], providing a consistent API regardless of the framework you choose to work with. This is facilitated by the provision of adapters, specifically designed to interact seamlessly with your chosen framework. You can find a comprehensive list of these adapters in the [Adapters][adapters] page.

Although the `@ibnlanre/builder` package is built using [TypeScript][typescript], its integration into your application is not mandatory. However, opting for [TypeScript][typescript] is a worthwhile consideration given the substantial enhancements it can offer to your codebase and development process. 

By choosing [TypeScript][typescript], you stand to gain from improved type safety and editor autocomplete for all builder APIs and state, making your coding experience smoother and more efficient.
