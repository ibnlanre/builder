# Working with Types

Type inference is a powerful feature in TypeScript that allows the compiler to deduce the types of variables based on their usage. The [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package leverages type inference to provide a seamless developer experience when working with types. This guide explores various ways to work with types in the [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package, including accessing the type of the [register][4], and the type of nested properties.

## Utility Types

TypeScript comes equipped with several utility types that can be used to manipulate and extract information from types. These utility types can be used to create new types, or to extract information from existing types. Among the most commonly used utility types are `ReturnType` and `Parameters`. These utility types are particularly useful when working with functions. You can find more utility types in the [TypeScript documentation][utility-types].

The following snippet demonstrates to extract types from a function:

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder({
  getHeight: () => Math.random() + 150,
  setSize: async (height: number, width: number) => {
    // ...
  },
});

// Use the ReturnType utility to get the return type of a function.
type Height = ReturnType<typeof builder.unbuild.getHeight>;
//   ^? number

// Use the Parameter utility to get the parameter type of a function.
type Width = Parameters<typeof builder.unbuild.setSize>[1];
//   ^? number
```

## Using Type Assertions

Type assertions are a way to tell the TypeScript compiler that a value has a specific type. This is useful when the compiler is unable to infer the type of a value, or when the type of a value is more specific than the compiler can determine. Type assertions can be used to assert the type of a property in a [builder][3] object.

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder({
  address: {} as {
    street: string;
    city: string;
    country: string;
    house: number;
  },
});

// Using `as` to assert the type of a property.
type Address = typeof builder.unbuild.address.house;
//   ^? number
```

## Using the `typeValue` function

To provide additional type information to a value in the [register][4], the `typeValue` function, exported by the [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package, can be used. Using this function is recommended over making type assertions, as it ensures that the type information is correctly associated with a value. 

To expatiate, the type information would not be made accessible through the `use` and `get` methods as it is not an actual value in the [register][4]. Regardless, the type information can be accessed using the `unbuild` property.

The following snippet demonstrates how to use the `typeValue` function:

```typescript copy
import { createBuilder, typeValue } from '@ibnlanre/builder';

const bar = typeValue({
  hello: 'world',
})<{
  id: number;
}>();

const builder = createBuilder({
  foo: {
    bar,
    baz: typeValue({
      id: 42,
    })(),
  },
});
```

The `typeValue` function is a curried function that initially accepts a value to which it will append any given type information. It then returns another function that takes the type information as a type parameter. When invoked, this returned function embellishes the initial value with a new `has` property, which holds the given type information.

<Callout type="info">Note that the `has` property is inserted as an **optional** property on the initial value, however, accessing its value through the `unbuild` property would display it as **required**.</Callout>

The following snippet demonstrates how to access the given type information:

```typescript copy
// Access the type of the `bar` property.
type Bar = typeof builder.unbuild.foo.bar;
//   ^? { hello: string; has: { id: number; } }

// Access the type of the `baz` property.
type Baz = typeof builder.unbuild.foo.baz;
//   ^? { id: number; has: {} }
```

## Key Conflicts

In a scenario where the added `has` property coincides with an existing property on the value, a second parameter can be passed to the `typeValue` function to specify the key under which the type information should be stored. This is to ensure that the type information is not lost, and that the value remains intact.

The following snippet demonstrates how to specify a different storage key:

```typescript copy
import { createBuilder, typeValue } from '@ibnlanre/builder';

const builder = createBuilder({
  foo: {
    qux: typeValue({
      hello: 'world',
      has: undefined,
    })<{ id: number }, "added">(),
  },
});

// Access the type of the `qux` property.
type Qux = typeof builder.unbuild.foo.qux;
//   ^? { hello: string; has: { id: number; }; added: {} }
```
