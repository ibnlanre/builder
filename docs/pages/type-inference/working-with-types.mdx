# Working with Types



```typescript copy

This is useful when the register exists within the location of use.

```typescript copy

Although the actual value of `builder.typeof` is `undefined`, the type of `builder.typeof` is the type of the object passed to the builder. To get the value, you can use either the `use` or `get` method.

```typescript copy

## Conclusion

In summary, the root node is the only node that return the register when accessed using the `use` method. The `get` method returns the prefixes used to create the `builder` object, and the `unbuild` property returns the inferred type of the register. This behavior is different from the other nodes, which generate keys from the nested keys of the register. The root node is a special case, and it is important to understand how it works.

For more information on the `builder` object, see the [overview](/overview) page.

```

## Utility Types

You can also use the `ReturnType` and `Parameters` utility types to get the return type of a function, or the parameter type of a function.

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder({
  getHeight: () => Math.random() + 150,
  setSize: async (height: number, width: number) => {
    // ...
  },
});

// Use the ReturnType utility to get the return type of a function.
type Height = ReturnType<typeof builder.typeof.getHeight>
//   ^? number

// Use the Parameter utility to get the parameter type of a function.
type Width = Parameters<typeof builder.typeof.setSize>[1]
//   ^? number
```

## Using Type Assertions

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder({
  address: {} as {
    street: string;
    city: string;
    country: string;
    house: number;
  },
});

// Using `as` to assert the type of a property.
type Address = typeof builder.typeof.address.house
//   ^? number
```

You can find more utility types in the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html).
