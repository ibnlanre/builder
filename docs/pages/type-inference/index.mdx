# Modular Types

Type modularization refers to the practice of organizing and managing types in a way that promotes reusability and maintainability, often through the use of import and export statements. To facilitate this process, the [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package provides ways to access the type of values stored within the builder, or the type of a nested property, without the need for manual type declarations.

## Accessing types

Although it is possible to inspect the type of the [register][4] by hovering over the [builder][3] object in an IDE, having a way to access the type programmatically is essential.

The [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package provides three primary ways to retrieve the type of the values stored within the [register][4]. Each method has its unique characteristics and use cases. This guide explains the various methods in detail, and which is best suited for a given scenario.

An example of a [builder][3] object created from a [register][4] is shown below:

```typescript copy
import { createBuilder } from '@ibnlanre/builder';

const register = {
  user: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 42,
  },
};

const builder = createBuilder(register);
```

### Checking the `register`

The type of the values stored in the [register][4] can be accessed directly using the [typeof][typeof] operator. This is useful when the [register][4] exists within the location of use. In scenarios where the type of the [register][4] is required outside the file it is defined in, exporting the [register][4] and importing it in the desired location is **not** advised. A better approach is to access the type of the [register][4] directly from the [builder][3] object.

```typescript copy
// Access the type of the register directly.
type UserAge = typeof register.user.age;
//   ^? number
```

### Using the `use` method

The `$use` property is a **read-only** attribute on the root node of the [builder][3] object, that returns the inferred type of the [register][4]. Unlike the `$use` and `$get` methods on other nodes, it is not a function and cannot be invoked. The `$use` property not only represents the [register][4] but also yields the anticipated result when accessed, ensuring the integrity of the [builder][3]'s inferred type.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the type of the [register][4] using the `$use` property:

```typescript copy
// Access the type of the register using the `$use` property.
type Register = typeof builder.$use;
//   ^? { name: string; age: number; }

// Access the type of a nested property using the `typeof` operator.
type UserName = typeof builder.$use.user.name;
//   ^? string
```

Had the `$use` property on the root node been a function, accessing the type of the [register][4] would require the use of the [typeof][typeof] operator coupled with the [ReturnType][return-type] utility type. Accessing nested types would also require the use of [bracket notation][bracket-notation] which is a chore, as opposed to using [dot notation][dot-notation], which is more convenient.

The following code snippet highlights the differences between using the [dot][dot-notation] and [bracket][bracket-notation] notations:

```typescript copy
// $use as a method on the builder
type Bar = ReturnType<typeof builder.$use>['foo']['bar'];

// $use as a property of the builder
type Bar = typeof builder.$use.foo.bar;
//   ^? number
```

## Addendum: Root node

In summary, the [root node][5] uniquely returns the [register][4] when the `$use` property is accessed. While the `$get` method, in contrast, yields the prefixes used in the creation of the [builder][3] object when it is called without arguments, and returns a string when it is called with arguments. This behavior diverges from that of other nodes, which generate keys from the nested keys within the [register][4]. Given its distinct characteristics, comprehending how the [root node][5] works is crucial.
