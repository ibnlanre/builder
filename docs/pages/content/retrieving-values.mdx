# The root branch

The root is the starting point of the `builder` object. It is effectively the register, which is passed to the `createBuilder` function. The root branch is the first branch of the `builder` object, and it is the only branch that does not have a key. The root branch is the only branch that can be accessed using the `use` function, and it returns the register itself. The `get` function on the other hand, returns the prefixes used to create the `builder` object.

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder({
  foo: {
    baz: (id: number) => `/bazaar/${id}`,
    bar: 10,
  },
}, ["root", "branch"]);
```

## Accessing register values

Calling the `use` function on the root branch returns the register itself. As a consequence, this allows us to access the nested values of the register. This is a different behavior from the other branches, which instead, generates a key from the nested keys of the register.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the root branch:

```typescript copy
builder.use(); // { foo: { baz: [Function: baz], bar: 10 } }

// Accessing a nested function value
builder.use().foo.baz(12); // "/bazaar/12"

// Accessing a nested primitive value
builder.use().foo.bar; // 10
```

## Retrieving the prefixes

Similarly, calling the `get` function on the root branch returns the prefixes associated with the `builder` object. If no prefix is set, the `get` function returns an empty array. 

The following code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the root branch using the `get` function:

```typescript copy
builder.get(); // ["root", "branch"]
```
