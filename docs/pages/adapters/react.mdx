# React Adapter

The `@ibnlanre/builder` package provides a set of hooks and components that make it easier to use the [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package with React. This guide explains how to use the React adapter to create and consume [builder][3] objects in a React application.

## Usage

The React adapter provides a set of hooks and components that simplify the process of creating and consuming [builder][3] objects in a React application. The adapter includes the following hooks and components:

- `useBuilder`: A custom hook that provides access to the [builders][4] prop in a React component.
- `BuilderProvider`: A context provider that provides the [builders][4] prop to all its children.

## Builder Provider

To access the `useBuilder` hook and the `BuilderProvider` component, you need to import the `useBuilderProvider` function from the x@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx package. The `useBuilderProvider` function is a custom hook that creates the `BuilderProvider` component and the `useBuilder` hook.

The `BuilderProvider` component is a [context][context] provider that provides the `builders` prop to all its children. While, the useBuilder hook is used to access the `builders` prop in any child component. Within a [TypeScript][typescript] environment, the `useBuilderProvider` does not need to be typed, as its type is inferred from the `builder` objects passed to it.

To use the `BuilderProvider`, you need to create [builder][4] objects using the [createBuilder][2] function, exported from the [@ibnlanre/builder][1] package. The [builder][4] objects are then passed to the `BuilderProvider` using the `useBuilderProvider` function.

The following code snippet illustrates how to use the `Builder Provider`:

```typescript copy
import { createBuilder } from "@ibnlanre/builder";

const userBuilder = createBuilder({
  user: {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
  },
});

const locationBuilder = createBuilder({
  location: {
    country: "Nigeria",
    city: "Lagos",
  },
});

export const { useBuilder, BuilderProvider } = useBuilderProvider({
  locationBuilder,
  userBuilder,
});
```

In the code snippet above, the `userBuilder` object is created using the `createBuilder` function. The `useBuilderProvider` function is then used to create the `BuilderProvider` component and the `useBuilder` hook. The `userBuilder` object is passed to the `useBuilderProvider` function as an argument.

## BuilderProvider

The `Builder Provider` is expected to be used in the root of your application to provide the `builders` prop to all its children. Alternatively, you can provide the `BuilderProvider` in a specific part of your application, under which children components can access the `builders` prop. The `BuilderProvider` component does not require any prop outside its children.

```typescript copy filename="App.tsx"
import { ChildrenWithProps } from "@ibnlanre/builder";



export function App({ children }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <BuilderProvider>
      <App />
    </BuilderProvider>
  );
}
```

## useBuilder

The `useBuilder` hook is used to access the `builders` prop in any child component.
