# React Adapter

The `@ibnlanre/builder` package provides a set of hooks and components that make it easier to work with [builder][3] objects in a React application. The React adapter, which is an extension of the `@ibnlanre/builder` package, simplifies the process of creating and consuming [builder][3] objects in a React application.

This guide explains how to use the React adapter to create and consume [builder][3] objects in a React application.

## `createBuilderProvider`

The React adapter exports a `createBuilderProvider` function that can be used to create a provider for [builder][4] objects in a React application. The `createBuilderProvider` function takes an object with [builder][4] objects as its argument and returns an object with the `useBuilder` hook and the `BuilderProvider` component. 

Within a [TypeScript][typescript] environment, the `createBuilderProvider` does not need to be typed, as its type is inferred from the `builder` objects passed to it.

```tsx copy filename="App.tsx"
import { createBuilder } from "@ibnlanre/builder";
import { createBuilderProvider } from "@ibnlanre/builder/react"

const userBuilder = createBuilder({
  user: {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
  },
});

const locationBuilder = createBuilder({
  location: {
    country: "Nigeria",
    city: "Lagos",
  },
});

export const { useBuilder, BuilderProvider } = createBuilderProvider({
  locationBuilder,
  userBuilder,
});
```

## `BuilderProvider`

The `BuilderProvider` component is a [context][context] provider that provides the `builders` prop to all its children. It is expected to be used in the root of your application. Alternatively, you can provide the `BuilderProvider` in a specific part of your application, under which children components can access the `builders` prop. The `BuilderProvider` component does not require any prop outside its children.

```tsx copy filename="App.tsx"
...
import { ChildrenWithProps } from "react";

interface AppProps extends ChildrenWithProps { }

export function App({ children }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <BuilderProvider>
      {children}
    </BuilderProvider>
  );
}
```

## `useBuilder`

The `useBuilder` hook is used to access the `builders` prop in any child component. It returns the `builders` prop provided by the `BuilderProvider` component. This allows you to access the required [builder][4] object in any child component of the `BuilderProvider` component. The `useBuilder` hook does not require any argument.

```tsx copy filename="User.tsx"
import { useBuilder } from "../App";

export function User() {
  const { userBuilder } = useBuilder();
  const { name, age } = userBuilder.use().user;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <p>{age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Summary

The React adapter provides a set of hooks and components that make it easier to work with [builder][4] objects in a React application. The `createBuilderProvider` function is used to create a provider for [builder][4] objects in a React application. The `BuilderProvider` component is a [context][context] provider that provides the `builders` prop to all its children. The `useBuilder` hook is used to access the `builders` prop in any child component.
