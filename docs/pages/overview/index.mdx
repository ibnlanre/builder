# Motivation

The `@ibnlanre/builder` package was created to address the issue of thinking about and managing keys in a data structure. It directs the process of key creation and management by providing a consistent and reliable way to generate keys dynamically. This makes it easier to work with key-based data structures, and shifts the focus from key deliberation to key usage.

The motivation behind the `@ibnlanre/builder` package is to provide a lightweight, efficient, and type-safe solution for generating and managing keys in a nested object. By encapsulating keys and values in a structured manner, it promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability. It also simplifies the process of key generation, reducing the risk of errors and improving code readability.

It is suitable for **large teams** working on complex projects, as it ensures that keys are generated consistently and that values are easily accessible. It automatically synchronizes changes to keys and values, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies. It also encourages collocating related keys and values, making it easier to organize and maintain the codebase. By enabling the encapsulation of common functionality into accessible values, it promotes code reuse and improves overall code quality. 

It is also suitable for **small teams** and **individual developers** working on smaller projects, seeking a type-safe and efficient way to work with keys. It is an invaluable tool for developers who want to focus on building features rather than managing keys, in an organized fashion.
