# Retrieving values

The root is the starting point of the `builder` object. It is effectively the register, which is passed to the `createBuilder` function. The root is the first argument of the `createBuilder` function.

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder({
  foo: {
    baz: (id: number) => `/bazaar/${id}`,
    bar: 10,
  },
}, "root", "branch");
```

## Root branch

Retrieving the root branch using the `use` function returns the register itself, while retrieving the root branch using the `get` function returns the key for the root branch. This is a different behavior from the other branches, which instead, generates a key from the nested keys of the register. The following code snippet demonstrates what the root branch looks like:

```typescript copy
builder.use(); // register
builder.get(); // ["root", "branch"]
```

## Nested values

As a consequence of the `use` function returning the register, it is possible to retrieve the nested values of the register. The following code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the nested values of the register:

```typescript copy
builder.use().foo.baz(12); // "/bazaar/12"
builder.use().foo.bar; // 10
```
