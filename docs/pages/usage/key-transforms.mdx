# Key transforms

Since the `key` returned from calling the `use` or `get` method is an array of strings, crafted from the nodes in the [register][4], it is possible to transform the key using any array method. There are several array methods, on the array prototype, that can be used to transform the key. You can learn more about these methods in the [MDN Web Docs][methods].

The following code snippet is a continuation of the previous example:

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder({
  foo: {
    baz: (id: number) => `/bazaar/${id}`,
    bar: 10,
  },
}, ["root"]);
```

### The `slice` method

One of such methods is the [slice][slice] method. The [slice][slice] method is a function that extracts a section of an array and returns a new array. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the [slice][slice] method:

```typescript copy
// extracting the first two elements of the array
builder.foo.baz.get().slice(2); // ["root", "foo"]
```

### The `join` method

Another array method that can be used to transform the key is the [join][join] method. The [join][join] method is a function that concatenates the value in an array into a single string, using a separator. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the [join][join] method:

```typescript copy
// concatenating the elements of the array into a single string
builder.foo.baz.get().join("."); // "root.node.foo.baz"
```
