# The root node

The root node, the starting point and first node of the builder object, behaves differently from other nodes when interacting with the `use` and `get` methods. When accessed using the `use` method, the root node returns the register itself, which is effectively the input to the [createBuilder][2] function.

Conversely, the `get` method returns the prefixes used to create the builder object. Unique to the root node is its lack of a key. However, a key can be assigned by passing an array of strings as a second argument to the [createBuilder][2] function, which then serves as the key for the root node and a prefix for other nodes.

This guide elucidates the behavior of the `use` and `get` methods specifically on the root node of the builder object.

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder({
  foo: {
    baz: (id: number) => `/bazaar/${id}`,
    bar: 10,
  },
}, ["root", "node"]);
```

## Retrieving values

Invoking the `use` method on the root node returns the register in its entirety, thereby enabling access to its values. This behavior is distinct from that of other nodes, which generate a key derived from the nested keys within the register, rather than providing direct access to the nested values.

Because of the dual-purpose nature of the `use` method, it is important to distinguish between the `use` method that returns the value and the `use` method that returns the key. The rule of thumb is to remember that the `use` method that returns the value is always situated closest to the root node. While the `use` method that returns the key is always situated at the end of the chain.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve register values:

```typescript copy
builder.use(); // { foo: { baz: [Function: baz], bar: 10 } }

// Accessing a nested function value
builder.use().foo.baz(12); // "/bazaar/12"

// Accessing a nested primitive value
builder.use().foo.bar; // 10
```

## Builder prefix

The root node, unique in its initial lack of a key, can be assigned one by passing an array of strings as a second argument to the [createBuilder][2] function. This array not only serves as the key for the root node but also as a prefix for other nodes. When the get method is invoked on the root node, it returns the prefixes that were used to create the [builder][3] object. If no prefix has been set, this method will return an empty array, reflecting the absence of associated prefixes.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the root key:

```typescript copy
builder.get(); // ["root", "node"]
```
