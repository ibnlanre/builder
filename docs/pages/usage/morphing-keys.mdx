# Morphing Keys

Since the key returned from calling the `$use` or `$get` method is an array of strings, crafted from the nodes in the [register][4], it is possible to transform the key using any array [method][array]. There are several methods, on the array [prototype][prototype], that can be used to transform the key. You can learn more about these methods in the [MDN Web Docs][methods].

The following code snippet is a continuation of the previous example:

```typescript copy
const register = {
  foo: {
    baz: (id: number) => `/bazaar/${id}`,
    bar: 10,
  },
};

const builder = createBuilder(register, { prefix: ["root"] });
```

### The `slice` method

One of such methods is the [slice][slice] method. The [slice][slice] method is a function that extracts a section of an array and returns a new array. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the [slice][slice] method:

```typescript copy
// extracting the first two elements of the array
builder.foo.baz.get().slice(2); // ["root", "foo"]
```

### The `join` method

Another array method that can be used to transform the key is the [join][join] method. The [join][join] method is a function that concatenates the value in an array into a single string, using a separator. The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the [join][join] method:

```typescript copy
// concatenating the elements of the array into a single string
builder.foo.baz.get().join("."); // "root.node.foo.baz"
```

### Conclusion

Note that to get the key as a string, you can call the `$get` method on the root node, then pass it the key, as an argument. This will return the key as a string. The `$get` method is typed to suggest the possible keys that can be passed to it, based on the structure of the [register][4].

The following code snippet demonstrates how to get the key as a string:

```typescript copy
builder.$get("root.node.foo.baz"); // "root.node.foo.baz"
```
