# Constructing keys

The main motivation behind the `builder` object is to provide a way of defining keys and values, without having to worry about constructing a meaningful key, or accessing its corresponding value. Generating the key requires either the `use` or `get` function. These functions are found at every level of the `builder` object. The `key` returned from calling the `use` or `get` function is an array of strings, crafted from the branches in the register.

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder({
  foo: {
    baz: (id: number) => `/bazaar/${id}`,
    bar: 10,
  },
}, ["root", "branch"]);
```
  

## `.use` function

The `use` function is used to retrieve the keys, expecting the same signature as the defined value. If the value of that branch is a primitive value, object or array, the `use` function expects no arguments. However, if the value is a function that expects arguments, the `use` function expects the same arguments. `foo.baz` is a function that expects an `id` of `number` type, therefore, the `use` function expects an `id` of `number` type as well. If the argument was optional, it would equally be optional.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `use` function:

```typescript copy
builder.foo.baz.use(11); // ["root", "branch", "foo", "baz", 11]
```

## `.get` function

The `get` function is used to retrieve the keys, without following the pattern defined by the value. It expects an arbitrary number of arguments, which are added to the returned array of strings. This flexibility is useful when you want to add more keys that are not defined in the register.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `get` function:

```typescript copy
builder.foo.baz.get(); // ["root", "branch", "foo", "baz"]
builder.foo.baz.get("test"); // ["root", "branch", "foo", "baz", "test"]
```

## Transforming the key using .join

Because the `key` returned from calling the `use` or `get` function is an array of strings, it is possible to transform the key using the `join` method. The `join` method is a function that concatenates the strings in the array, using a separator.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `join` functions:

```typescript copy
builder.foo.baz.get().join("."); // "root.branch.foo.baz"

// notice the `slice` function is used to remove the first two elements of the array.
builder.foo.baz.use(11).slice(2).join("/"); // "foo/baz/11"
```
