# Constructing keys

The main motivation behind the `builder` object is to provide a way of defining keys and values, without having to worry about constructing a meaningful key, or accessing its corresponding value. Generating the key requires either the `use` or `get` function. These functions are found at every level of the `builder` object. The `key` returned from calling the `use` or `get` function is an array of strings, crafted from the nodes in the register.

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder({
  foo: {
    baz: (id: number) => `/bazaar/${id}`,
    bar: 10,
  },
}, ["root", "node"]);
```
  

## `.use` function

The `use` function is used to retrieve the keys, expecting the same signature as the defined value. If the value of that node is a primitive value, object or array, the `use` function expects no arguments. However, if the value is a function that expects arguments, the `use` function expects the same arguments. `foo.baz` is a function that expects an `id` of `number` type, therefore, the `use` function expects an `id` of `number` type as well. If the argument was optional, it would equally be optional.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `use` function:

```typescript copy
builder.foo.baz.use(11); // ["root", "node", "foo", "baz", 11]
```
