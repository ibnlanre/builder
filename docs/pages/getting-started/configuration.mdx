# Configuration

To use the `@ibnlanre/builder` package, you need to create a `builder` object from a register. The `builder` object provides methods for key generation and value retrieval from the register. This guide explains how to create a `builder` object and use it to access keys and values from the register. 

## Defining registers

A register is a plain object that contains the keys and values that you want to access. The register can contain nested objects, functions, or values. It is passed as an argument to the `createBuilder` function, which returns a `builder` object. The register is the **soul** of the `builder` object, as it is the source of the keys and values contained within the `builder` object.

The following code snippet show what a typical register looks like:

```typescript copy
const register = {
  user: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john.doe@jmail.com'
  },
};
```

## Nested registers

Registers can be made to have complex structures by nesting objects within objects. This allows you to group related keys and values together. The recommended approach is to keep the register as flat as possible, to avoid unnecessary complexity. This can be achieved by creating multiple registers, each with a specific purpose, and nesting them within the main register.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a register with nested objects:

```typescript copy
const create = (data: { email: string; password: string }) => {
  return fetch("/account/create", {
    headers: {
      Accept: "application/json",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
    method: "POST",
  });
};

const delete_by_id = (id: number) => {
  return fetch(`/account/${id}/delete`, {
    method: "DELETE",
  });
};

const register = {
  account: {
    delete_by_id,
    create,
  },
};
```
