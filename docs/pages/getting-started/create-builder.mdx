# `createBuilder`

The `createBuilder` function is a factory function that accepts a register and an optional list of prefixes as arguments. `createBuilder` is exported as a named export from the `@ibnlanre/builder` package.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to import the `createBuilder` function:

```typescript copy
import { createBuilder } from '@ibnlanre/builder';
```

## Creating a builder

Upon passing the register to the `createBuilder` function, an object that provides methods for accessing the keys and values of the register is returned. This object is referred to as the `builder`. The `builder` object is a tree-like structure, having the root of the register as its starting point, and the nodes as its keys. 

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a `builder` object using the `createBuilder` function:

```typescript copy
const noPrefixBuilder = createBuilder(register);
```

## Builder with prefixes

If the `builder` object is created with prefixes, the generated keys array would be prefixed with the prefixes, followed by the keys accessed in the register. The prefixes serve as an identifier for each `builder` object created. Although there is no limit to the number of prefixes that can be used, it is advised to use a maximum of three prefixes.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `createBuilder` function with prefixes:

```typescript copy
const builder = createBuilder(register, ["user", "record"]);
```
