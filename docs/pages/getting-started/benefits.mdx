# Benefits
`@ibnlanre/builder` is particularly beneficial for **large teams** working on complex projects. It ensures consistent key generation and easy access to values, automatically synchronizing changes to keys and values to minimize the risk of errors and inconsistencies. The package also encourages the collocation of related keys and values, facilitating code organization and maintenance. By allowing common functionality to be encapsulated into accessible values, it promotes code reuse and improves overall code quality.

The package is also a valuable tool for **small teams** and **individual developers** working on smaller projects. It provides a type-safe and efficient way to work with keys, allowing developers to focus on building features in an organized manner, rather than managing keys. The numerous benefits it offers further enhance its value as a useful tool for developers. These benefits include:

- **Simplicity**: It simplifies the process of creating keys, making it easier to manage cache-based state in applications.
- **Efficiency**: It streamlines key generation by eliminating the need for manual construction, improving code quality and efficiency.
- **Ease of Use**: It can be easily integrated into existing code bases without requiring extensive refactoring, while gracefully handling errors.
- **Type Safety**: It provides auto-completion support and ensures accurate value retrievals, thereby, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
- **Performance**: It is lightweight and has minimal overhead, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.
- **Maintainability**: It enhances code maintainability by promoting separation of concerns and improving code organization.
