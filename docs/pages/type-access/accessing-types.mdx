# Accessing types

The `builder` object provides a type-safe way to access the values stored in the register. The type of the register is inferred from the values passed to the `createBuilder` function during initialization. This ability is unique to the root node of the `builder` object, as it is effectively the register itself. This document explains how to access the type of the register using the `builder` object.

An example of a `builder` object created from a register is shown below:

```typescript copy
import { createBuilder } from '@ibnlanre/builder';

const register = {
  user: {
    name: 'John Doe',
  },
  ...
};

const builder = createBuilder(register);
```

## The `map` property

The preferred way to access the type of the register is to use the `unbuild` property on the root node of the `builder` object. The `unbuild` property returns the inferred type of the register, which is useful in cases involving an interface or type assignment. Unlike the `use` and `get` methods, `unbuild` is not a function, and is exclusive to the root node of the `builder` object. Although, it is possible to see the type of the register by hovering over the `builder` object in an IDE, the `unbuild` property provides a way to access the type programmatically. 

The following code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the type of the register using the `unbuild` property:

```typescript copy
const map = builder.map.user.name
console.log(map); // Output: string
```

### Checking the `register`

The type of the values stored in the register can be accessed directly using the [typeof](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/typeof-types.html) operator. This is useful when the register exists within the location of use. The following code snippet demonstrates how to access the type of the register using the `typeof` operator:

```typescript copy
type UserName = typeof register.user.name;
```

### Using the `use` method

The `use` method carries the associated type of every accessed key, but its primary purpose is to retrieves keys and values from the register. It is also a function, and therefore cannot be used to access the type directly.

To access the type using the `use` method, would require the use of the [typeof](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/typeof-types.html) operator, as well as, the [ReturnType](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#returntypetype) utility type. Accessing nested types would also require the use of [bracket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors#bracket_notation) notation. This makes using [use](/overview#the-use-method) a chore for accessing the type of the register. The `unbuild` property provides a more convenient way to access the type of the register, using [dot](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors#dot_notation) notation.

## Conclusion

In summary, the root node is the only node that return the register when accessed using the `use` method. The `get` method returns the prefixes used to create the `builder` object, and the `unbuild` property returns the inferred type of the register. This behavior is different from the other nodes, which generate keys from the nested keys of the register. The root node is a special case, and it is important to understand how it works.
