# Welcome

Have you ever struggled with managing cache keys in your application? String inconsistencies, verbose key construction, or manually building complex nested keys like `['users', 'list', { page: 1, filter: 'active' }]` for every query?

**`@ibnlanre/builder`** solves this problem by letting you define your keys once in a structured way, then access them with full TypeScript autocomplete and type-safety.

## The Problem

Here's a typical scenario when working with data fetching libraries:

```typescript
// ❌ Without builder: Error-prone and repetitive
useQuery({ queryKey: ['users', 'detail', userId], ... }); // Manual string construction

useQuery({ queryKey: ['user', 'detail', userId], ... });  // Oops! Singular/plural mismatch

// Different developers might format keys differently
useQuery({ queryKey: ['userDetail', userId], ... });      // Inconsistent structure
```

## The Solution

With `@ibnlanre/builder`, you define your key structure once:

```typescript
// ✅ With builder: Type-safe and consistent
const api = createBuilder({
  users: {
    list: (params: { page: number }) => fetchUsers(params),
    detail: (id: number) => fetchUser(id)
  }
});

// Now use it anywhere with autocomplete
useQuery({
  queryKey: api.users.detail.$use(userId),  // ['users', 'detail', 123]
  queryFn: () => api.$use.users.detail(userId)
});
```

**Benefits you get immediately:**
- ✨ **Autocomplete** - Your editor suggests available keys
- 🛡️ **Type-safe** - Wrong parameters? TypeScript catches it
- 🎯 **Single source of truth** - Change key structure in one place
- 📦 **Tiny** - [0.4KB][bundlephobia] gzipped

## What is Builder?

The `@ibnlanre/builder` package is a lightweight tool that transforms a nested object (called a "register") into a smart builder object. This builder lets you:

1. **Generate keys dynamically** with the `$use` or `$get` methods
2. **Access your functions and values** through the `$use` property
3. **Keep everything organized** in one central location

It's [framework-agnostic][pluralsight]. It works with [React][react], [Vue][vue], [Svelte][svelte], or vanilla [JavaScript][pluralsight]/[TypeScript][typescript].

It is really nice! It's <strong>lightweight</strong> and robust.<br />Builder is [0.4KB][bundlephobia] gzipped.

## Why Builder?

Originally built to manage keys for [TanStack Query][tanstack] (formerly React Query), Builder proved useful for any scenario involving key-based data structures:

- **Cache keys** (SWR, TanStack Query, Apollo)
- **Route parameters** (React Router, Next.js)
- **Form field names** (React Hook Form, Formik)
- **Localization keys** (i18next, react-intl)
- **Storage keys** (localStorage, IndexedDB)

By encapsulating keys and values together, you get better organization, easier refactoring, and type-safe access throughout your codebase.

Honestly can't have it any other way.<br /><small className="nx-not-italic nx-mt-3 nx-inline-block">- [Prosper Jaja](https://linkedin.com/in/prosper-jaja-3076aa264)</small></blockquote>
