## FAQs

### What is the purpose of the @ibnlanre/builder library?

The @ibnlanre/builder library is designed to streamline dynamic key generation, making it easier to manage cache keys in a nested object. By creating a builder object, developers can access and retrieve values from the register, without the need for manual key construction.

### How does the @ibnlanre/builder library work?

The @ibnlanre/builder library creates a builder object using the createBuilder function. This object contains methods for retrieving the value of a key, making it easier to locate and reuse keys. By chaining the nodes of a register into an array of keys, it streamlines the process of key generation and retrieval.

### What are the key features of the @ibnlanre/builder library?

The key features of the @ibnlanre/builder library include the builder object, dynamic key generation, colocation of values, efficient value retrieval, flexible usage, and type safety. These features make it easier to manage cache keys in a nested object, improving code readability and maintainability.

### How can I customize key generation with the @ibnlanre/builder library?

You can customize key generation with the @ibnlanre/builder library by providing an array of prefixes. These prefixes are used to generate the keys for the builder object, making it easier to access and retrieve values from a register.
